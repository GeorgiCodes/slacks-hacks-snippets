# slacks-hacks-snippets
Snippets of JS or CSS, served via github pages, to inject into your team/user with https://github.com/bhuga/hackable-slack-client. See the README there for more information.

You can access snippets here at `hax://bhuga.github.io/slacks-hacks-snippets/<filename>`.

For example, if your team is using https://github.com/bhuga/slacks-hacks, your
default font is Slack-lato instead of Helvetica. If you'd like Helvetica back,
add this string anywhere to the `Title` area of your profile:

`hax://bhuga.github.io/slacks-hacks-snippets/remove-helvetica.css`
